                    To find out the Promise hierarchy, <strong>PromiseTree</strong> needs to do some digging.<br/>
                    The V8 JavaScript engine in Chrome allows it. (SpiderMonkey in FireFox does not...)</span>

                <h3><strong>Long Explanation:</strong></h3>
                <span class="lead">
                    Well, this is related to how JavaScript works...<br/>
                    Promises are asynchronous by nature, it resolves after an asynchronous call is completed via a callback.<br/>
                    The Event Loop invokes the callback, this is done when the stack is empty so a callbacks stack has no meaning.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    To track hierarchy, <strong>PromiseTree</strong> has to inspect the "caller" of the Promise, where clues are set to identify the hierarchy.
                    This method requires working in "non-strict" mode, which is fine since <strong>PromiseTree</strong> is for education and/or debug use cases.
                    Chrome's V8 interperates the 'use string;' instruction in a way that works for <strong>PromiseTree</strong>, FireFox's SpiderMonkey for example interperates it differently so it doesn't work.
                    (Chrome set strict based upon the callee instructing it, FireFox based upon the caller of the callee instructing it, they are both right).
