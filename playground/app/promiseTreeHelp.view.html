    <h2>Javascript code editor pane</h2>
    <div style="margin-left: 10px">
        <p> The Javascript code editor pane is located on the <strong>Playground</strong> page on the left side. It allows you to write javascript promise code and see the results on the right pane.</p>
        <p>You can run your own custom code or use pre defined code examples by selecting an example from the selection box above the top right corner of the editor.</p>
        <p>Once your code has finished you need to notify it to the visualizer so he can render the graph.
            This is done by simply calling the function <strong>createPromiseTree(timeoutMS, callback)</strong>.
            The function has 2 optional parameter:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>timeoutMS:</strong> The time to wait, in milliseconds before rendering the tree.</li>
            <li><strong>callback:</strong> A callback function to invoke once graph is ready.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Currently, <strong><i>PromiseTree Visualizer</i></strong> supports the "fetch" library for invoking XHR request using a promise wrapper. You will need a server that supports CORS requests</p>
    <h2>Graph pane</h2>
    <div style="margin-left: 10px">
        <p>The Graph pane is located on the <strong>Playground</strong> page on the right side.
            <br />The Graph pane allows you to view the promise structure created by your code in 2 ways:</p>
        <p><h3>JSON View</h3></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 5px">
            <p>
                JSON View is the JSON representation of the graph, collection of Promises with thier associated children. <br />
                The view will populate automatically once a successful "Run" operation has finished and it is also editable,
                so you can change values or paste a JSON graph you created locally on your machine either in NodeJS or in your browser
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Tree View</h3>
        <div style="margin-left: 10px">
            The "Tree View" is just a graphical representation of the promise tree, it has 2 main building blocks:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Promise Node:</strong> Represented by a square, a Promise Node is represents a "Promise" in your code.</li>
                <li><strong>Link:</strong> Represented by a line, connecting to Promise Node's, a Link is a visual object representing the flow.</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <h4>Tree View Legend</h4>
            <div style="margin-left: 10px">
                The definitions below reffers to the term "<strong>executer</strong>" multiple times, the executer is a function incharge of resolving or rejecting the promise.
                Here is the exact definition from the mozilla developer network: <br/>
                <blockquote>
                    Function object with two arguments resolve and reject. The first argument fulfills the promise, the second argument rejects it. We can call these functions, once our operation is completed.
                </blockquote>

                                Represents a promise that runs under the context of a another promise.<br />
                                Think about the example given in the <div class="promise-node promise-node-promise"><span>Promise</span></div> description,
                                A <div class="promise-node promise-node-zone"><span>ZonePromise</span></div> is a new promise created in the scope of the executor.
                                A ZonePromises does not have to resolve before thier parent resolves.<br />
                                A Good example is the <strong>Promise.all</strong> & <strong>Promise.race</strong> promise helpers, Promise.all will resolve once all of his children will resolve, Promise.race will resolve on the first resolve event of his children. </span>

                                <strong>Flow:</strong> A Green/Red link describes a flow from the left (parent) to the right (child/successor), i.e: A value or an Exception resolved from the left moved to hanndling on the right.

                                Represents a connection between a Promise and promise/s (a.k.a: step-children) called in it's executor scope.
                                The step-children can be called from the direct scope of the executor or any scope of invoked functions down the stack.<br />
                                The flow in this situation is opposite to the flow of a Green/Red link and goes from the right to the left.<br /><br />
                                This is not a physical connection/flow rather then a conceptual one, The Parent promise resolve according to the logic defined in its executor.
                                The logic can take into consideration some, all or none of the step-children promise's it invoked in the process.
                                So the resolved (or rejected) value might or might not involve resolved (or rejected) values from its step-children.
